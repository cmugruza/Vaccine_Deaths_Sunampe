Logistic regression analysis was employed to model the relationship between various parental concerns and access barriers (independent variables) and this vaccination outcome (dependent variable).\n","\n","Prior to conducting the logistic regression, the dataset was pre-processed to handle missing values. Numerical variables were imputed with the mean, and categorical variables with the mode. To address potential issues of perfect separation or quasi-separation, which can lead to unstable model estimates, a thorough examination of the relationship between each predictor variable and the outcome variable was conducted using cross-tabulations and frequency counts. Predictor variables exhibiting perfect or near-perfect prediction of the outcome were excluded from the logistic regression model to ensure model stability and interpretability.\n","\n","The final logistic regression model's coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and odds ratios were examined to determine the strength and direction of the associations between the independent variables and the likelihood of other variables. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as the classification report, confusion matrix, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve with the Area Under the Curve (AUC).
